# bored_api

Weather app project using OpenWeather api , Flutter ,etc...

Note: To use this api: /n
-Create an account to get your AppId /n
-Change the appId in the response URL in the WeatherService file /n
-Since I am very poor so this application can only use some provided APIs for free users. You can buy subscription to use all of APIs for this application.
